                <h2>Thank you for your interest in ArtsFest 2020!</h2>
                <p>We are so excited to bring music, dance, theatre, visual arts, and film together for the community to see just how amazing our local art scene is!</p>
                <p>On <strong>April 18th</strong>, we’ll have 4-5 buildings on campus full of activities for anyone to attend.</p>
                <p>Visual Arts has a building to itself where we will have a gallery on the 2nd and 3rd floors in the Parcells Building on Amarillo College Campus (Washington). </p>
                <p>The 2nd floor will showcase various styles of paintings, and sculptures, while the 3rd floor will feature local photographers’ works, and a photography class hosted by Renee West. Auburn Adams will also offer a painting class during the day on campus in a separate building.  Times for this class will be available at www.amarilloartsfest.com soon.</p>
                <p>Outside, just north of the Parcells Building, we will have booth spaces for local artisans to share their talents with people passing through all the days events.</p>
